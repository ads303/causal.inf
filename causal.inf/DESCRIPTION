Description: Estimate the causal effect of a single variable or multiple variables using the backdoor criterion.
    A set of variables Z satisfies the back-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables     
    (I, J) in a DAG "G" if: i) no node in Z is a descendant of I, and ii) Z blocks every path that 
    contains an arrow into I. This package helps identify causal effects in your biomedical (or     
    other) data using the backdoor criterion.
