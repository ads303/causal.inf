Description: Estimate causal effect of a single variable or multiple variables using the backdoor   
    criterion.
    A set of variables Z satisfies the back-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables     
    (Xi, Xj) in a DAG "G" if: i) no node in Z is a descendant of Xi, and ii) Z blocks every path that 
    contains an arrow into Xi. This package helps identify causal effects in your biomedical data   
    using the backdoor criterion.
